I'm Joe Harman, a senior research scientist and bioinformatician at Dark Blue Therapeutics (DBT). 

I have ten years of experience spanning both academic and industry research. I began my career in the de Bruijn lab as a research assistant (2015-2018), before completing my DPhil in the Milne lab at the Weatherall Institute, University of Oxford (2018-2023). 

My doctoral work focused on integrating multi-omics datasets (bulk and single-cell) to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in cancer and in embryonic haematopoiesis. I complemented this computational work with molecular biology and CRISPR genome editing, validating GRN predictions in mouse embryonic stem cells and leukaemic cell models.

At DBT, I apply this dual skill set to drug discovery projects. I have supported lead programs through molecular biology assays and bioinformatics analyses, contributed to assay development that established screening platforms now used in early-stage projects, and built Dotmatics-based screening protocols, drawing on SQL and database expertise. In collaboration with consultants, I have also established bioinformatics infrastructure, including AWS cloud storage and scalable Nextflow pipelines.

My work bridges computational and experimental biology, and I am motivated by the challenge of connecting large-scale genomic data with molecular experimentation to address key questions in drug discovery.
